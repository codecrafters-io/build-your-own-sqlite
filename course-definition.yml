    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `.dbinfo` [dot command](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_), which prints metadata about a SQLite database.

      ### `.dbinfo`

      The `.dbinfo` command is executed like this:
      ```
      $ sqlite3 sample.db .dbinfo
      ```

      It outputs metadata about the database file:
      ```yaml
      database page size:  4096
      write format:        1
      read format:         1
      ...
      number of tables:    5
      schema size:         330
      data version:        1
      ```

      In this stage, your `.dbinfo` command only needs to output the "database page size."

      ### Database file

      The SQLite database file begins with the database header. The database page size is stored in the header, right after the magic string. It's a 2-byte, big-endian value (read left-to-right).
      ```
      // Start of file
      53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66 6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00  // Magic string: "SQLite format 3" + null terminator.
      10 00                                            /* Database page size, in bytes.
                                                          Here, the page size is 4096 bytes. */
      ...
      ```

      ### Tests

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh sample.db .dbinfo
      ```

      Your program must print the database page size of the database file, like this:
      ```
      database page size: 4096
      ```

      ### Notes

      - For more information about the SQLite database file format, see the [Database File Format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#the_database_header) guide.
      - Database headers use big-endian to store multi-byte fields. See the [MDN article on endianness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness) to learn more.

      In this stage, you'll implement one of SQLite's
      [dot-commands](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_): `.dbinfo`. This command
      prints metadata related a SQLite database, and you'll implement one of these values: the database page size. You'll
      do this by parsing a file that uses the [SQLite database file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html).

  - slug: "ce0"
    name: "Print number of tables"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add "number of tables" to your `.dbinfo` command's output.

      ### The `sqlite_schema` table

      To get the number of tables in a SQLite database, you need to examine the database's [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table. The `sqlite_schema` table stores the database schema.

      For each table, index, view, or trigger in the database, there's a corresponding row in `sqlite_schema`. The one exception is that there's no row for the `sqlite_schema` table itself.

      To see what `sqlite_schema` looks like, run this command:
      ```
      $ sqlite3 sample.db "SELECT * FROM sqlite_schema;"
      ```

      In this challenge, you can assume that databases only contain tables—no indexes, views, or triggers. So, each row in `sqlite_schema` represents a table in the database. As a result, you can get the total number of tables in the database by getting the number of rows in `sqlite_schema`.

      ### Pages

      A SQLite database file is made up of one or more [pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#pages). All tables, including `sqlite_schema`, are stored on one or more [table b-tree pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages).

      In this challenge, you can assume that the `sqlite_schema` table is small enough to fit entirely on a single page. (In reality, it can sometimes span multiple pages.) In order to get the number of rows in `sqlite_schema`, you need to read the `sqlite_schema` page.

      #### The `sqlite_schema` page

      You'll learn more about b-tree pages in later stages. For now, here's what you need to know:
      - The `sqlite_schema` page is always page 1, and it always begins at offset 0. The file header is a part of the page.
      - The `sqlite_schema` page stores the rows of the `sqlite_schema` table in chunks of data called "cells." Each cell stores a single row.

      So, the number of tables in the database is equal to the number of cells on the `sqlite_schema` page.

      #### Cell count

      You can get the number of cells on the `sqlite_schema` page by looking at the `sqlite_schema` page header. The b-tree page header contains a 2-byte big-endian value that specifies number of cells on the page. See the [official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) for more information.

      Note that the page header is separate from the file header. The page header appears directly after the file header.

      ### Tests

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh sample.db .dbinfo
      ```

      Your program must print the following values:
      - Database page size
      - Number of tables

      ```
      database page size: 4096
      number of tables: 3
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You may find it useful to read through `sample.db` and make sure you understand the file format, before working on a solution. To do this, you can run `hexdump -C sample.db`, or use a hex editor like [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/).

      Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
      {{/reader_is_bot}}
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll extend support for the .dbinfo command added in the previous stage. Specifically, you'll
      implement functionality to print the number of tables. You'll do this by parsing a file that uses the
      [SQLite database file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html).

  - slug: "sz4"
    name: "Print table names"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `.tables` [dot command](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_), which prints the names of the user tables in a SQLite database.

      ### The `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` column

      The names of the tables in a SQLite database are stored in the `tbl_name` column of the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table. The `sqlite_schema` [page](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) stores the rows of the `sqlite_schema` table in chunks of data called "cells." Each cell contains a single row. You need to read all the cells and extract the value of `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` from each one.

      ### Cell pointer array

      To figure out where the cells are located, read the `sqlite_schema` page's cell pointer array. This array specifies the offsets of every cell on the page. Here's what you need to know:

      - The array appears directly after the page header.
      - The elements (offsets) are 2-byte big-endian values.
      - The offsets are relative to the start of the page.
      - The array size is equal to the number of cells on the page. (The page header specifies the number of cells on the page.)

      ### Cell

      Once you have all the offsets, you can read the cells. The type of cell on the `sqlite_schema` page is called a "table b-tree leaf cell." It's made up of three parts:

      1. The size of the record, in bytes (varint)
      2. The rowid (varint)
      3. The record (record format)

      Cells use variable-length integers, also called "varints." See the [official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) to learn how they work.

      You can ignore the rowid—it's not relevant to this stage.

      The part you're interested in is the record. "Record" is just another word for "row." That's the part that contains the `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` column.

      #### Record format

      Records are stored in [record format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format):

      1. Header:
          1. Size of the header, including this value (varint)
          2. Serial type code for each column in the record, in order (varint)
      2. Body:
          1. The value of each column in the record, in order (format varies based on serial type code)

      A "serial type code" specifies the data type and size of a column. See the [official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format) for the table of all serial type codes.

      #### Example

      The following is a cell from page 1 of `sample.db`:
      ```
      00000ec0           78 03 07 17 1b  1b 01 81 47 74 61 62 6c  |   x.......Gtabl|

      ```

      Here's an analysis of the cell:
      ```
      // Size of the record (varint): 120
      78

      // The rowid (safe to ignore)
      03

      // Record header
      07     // Size of record header (varint): 7

      17     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.type (varint):     23
             // Size of sqlite_schema.type =                     (23-13)/2 = 5

      1b     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.name (varint):     27
             // Size of sqlite_schema.name =                     (27-13)/2 = 7

             // Size of sqlite_schema.tbl_name =                 (27-13)/2 = 7

      01     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.rootpage (varint): 1
             // 8-bit twos-complement integer

      81 47  // Serial type for sqlite_schema.sql (varint):      199
             // Size of sqlite_schema.sql =                      (199-13)/2 = 93

      // Record body
      74 61 62 6c 65        // Value of sqlite_schema.type:     "table"
      6f 72 61 6e 67 65 73  // Value of sqlite_schema.name:     "oranges"
      6f 72 61 6e 67 65 73  // Value of sqlite_schema.tbl_name: "oranges"  <---
      ...
      ```

      ### Tests

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_sqlite3.sh sample.db .tables
      ```

      Your program must print the names of the tables in the database file:
      ```
      apples oranges
      ```

      ### Notes

      - The actual `.tables` command accepts an optional pattern argument, and also adds additional spaces between each table name, for formatting purposes. You do not need to implement either of these features for your `.tables` command.
      - If a cell's payload is too large to fit on a single page, the remainder of the payload will be stored on [cell payload overflow pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#cell_payload_overflow_pages). You do not need to handle payload overflow in this challenge.
      - The record part of a cell is called "payload," in the official documentation.

      Now that you've gotten your feet wet with the [SQLite database file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html),
      it's time to move on to actual SQL!

      In this stage, your program will need to read the count of rows from a table.

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:

      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh sample.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM apples"
      ```

      and here's the output it expects:

      ```
      4
      ```

      You'll need to read the table's row from the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table and
      follow the `rootpage` value to visit the page corresponding to the table. For now you can assume that the contents
      of the table are small enough to fit inside the root page. We'll deal with tables that span multiple pages in
      stage 7.

      Remember: You don't need to implement a full-blown SQL parser just yet. We'll get to that in the
      next stages. For now you can just split the input by " " and pick the last item to get the table name.

      Now that you're comfortable with jumping across database pages, let's dig a little deeper and read data from

      The order of rows returned doesn't matter.

      Rows are stored on disk in the [Record Format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format), which is
      just an ordered sequence of values. To extract data for a single column, you'll need to know the order of that
      column in the sequence. You'll need to parse the table's `CREATE TABLE` statement to do this. The `CREATE TABLE`
      statement is stored in the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table's `sql` column.

      [Busying Oneself With B-Trees](https://medium.com/basecs/busying-oneself-with-b-trees-78bbf10522e7) is a good place to
      start. For specifics on how SQLite stores B-trees on disk, read the
      [B-tree Pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) documentation section.

      In this stage, you'll filter records based on a `WHERE` clause. You'll assume that the query can't be served by
      an index, so you'll visit all records in a table and then filter out the matching ones.

      In this stage, we'll implement an index scan. Rather than reading _all_ rows in a table and then filtering
      in-memory, we'll use an index to perform a more intelligent search.

      To test whether your implementation actually uses an index, the tester will use a database is ~1GB in size and
      expect your program to return query results in less than 3 seconds.

      The test database contains a `companies` table with an index named `idx_companies_country` on the
      `country` column.

      You can download a small version of this database to test locally, read the **Sample Databases** section in the **README**
      of your repository for details.

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:

      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh companies.db "SELECT id, name FROM companies WHERE country = 'eritrea'"
      ```

      and here's the output it expects:

      ```
      121311|unilink s.c.
      2102438|orange asmara it solutions
      5729848|zara mining share company
      6634629|asmara rental
      ```

      You can assume that all queries run by the tester will include `country` in the `WHERE` clause,
      so they can be served by the index. The tester will run multiple randomized queries and expect all of them
      to return results in under 3 seconds.

      This stage is similar to the previous one, but focuses on enhancing query performance using an index. In this
      stage, your program will need to read through millions of rows in under 5 seconds.
