In this stage, you'll support filtering records using a `WHERE` clause.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_program.sh sample.db "SELECT name, color FROM apples WHERE color = 'Yellow'"
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
Golden Delicious|Yellow
```

For now you can assume that the contents of the table are small enough to fit inside the root page. We'll deal
with tables that span multiple pages in the next stage.

Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
