In this stage, you'll implement the `.tables` [dot command](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_), which prints the names of the user tables in a SQLite database.

### The `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` column

The names of the tables in a SQLite database are stored in the `tbl_name` column of the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table. The `sqlite_schema` [page](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) stores the rows of the `sqlite_schema` table in chunks of data called "cells." Each cell contains a single row. You need to read all the cells and extract the value of `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` from each one.

### Cell pointer array

To figure out where the cells are located, read the `sqlite_schema` page's cell pointer array. This array specifies the offsets of every cell on the page. Here's what you need to know:

- The array appears directly after the page header.
- The elements (offsets) are 2-byte big-endian values.
- The offsets are relative to the start of the page.
- The array size is equal to the number of cells on the page. (The page header specifies the number of cells on the page.)

### Cell

Once you have all the offsets, you can read the cells. The type of cell on the `sqlite_schema` page is called a "table b-tree leaf cell." It's made up of three parts:

1. The size of the record, in bytes (varint)
2. The rowid (varint)
3. The record (record format)

Cells use variable-length integers, also called "varints." See the [official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) to learn how they work.

You can ignore the rowidâ€”it's not relevant to this stage.

The part you're interested in is the record. "Record" is just another word for "row." That's the part that contains the `sqlite_schema.tbl_name` column.

#### Record format

Records are stored in [record format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format):

1. Header:
    1. Size of the header, including this value (varint)
    2. Serial type code for each column in the record, in order (varint)
2. Body:
    1. The value of each column in the record, in order (format varies based on serial type code)

A "serial type code" specifies the data type and size of a column. See the [official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format) for the table of all serial type codes.

#### Example

The following is a cell from page 1 of `sample.db`:
```
00000ec0           78 03 07 17 1b  1b 01 81 47 74 61 62 6c  |   x.......Gtabl|

00000ee0  43 52 45 41 54 45 20 54  41 42 4c 45 20 6f 72 61  |CREATE TABLE ora|

00000f30  69 70 74 69 6f 6e 20 74  65 78 74 0a 29           |iption text.)   |
```

Here's an analysis of the cell:
```
// Size of the record (varint): 120
78

// The rowid (safe to ignore)
03

// Record header
07     // Size of record header (varint): 7

17     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.type (varint):     23
       // Size of sqlite_schema.type =                     (23-13)/2 = 5

1b     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.name (varint):     27
       // Size of sqlite_schema.name =                     (27-13)/2 = 7

1b     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.tbl_name (varint): 27
       // Size of sqlite_schema.tbl_name =                 (27-13)/2 = 7

01     // Serial type for sqlite_schema.rootpage (varint): 1
       // 8-bit twos-complement integer

81 47  // Serial type for sqlite_schema.sql (varint):      199
       // Size of sqlite_schema.sql =                      (199-13)/2 = 93

// Record body
74 61 62 6c 65        // Value of sqlite_schema.type:     "table"
6f 72 61 6e 67 65 73  // Value of sqlite_schema.name:     "oranges"
6f 72 61 6e 67 65 73  // Value of sqlite_schema.tbl_name: "oranges"  <---
...
```

### Tests

Here's how the tester will execute your program:
```
$ ./your_sqlite3.sh sample.db .tables
```

Your program must print the names of the tables in the database file:
```
apples oranges
```

### Notes

- The actual `.tables` command accepts an optional pattern argument, and also adds additional spaces between each table name, for formatting purposes. You do not need to implement either of these features for your `.tables` command.
- If a cell's payload is too large to fit on a single page, the remainder of the payload will be stored on [cell payload overflow pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#cell_payload_overflow_pages). You do not need to handle payload overflow in this challenge.
- The record part of a cell is called "payload," in the official documentation.
