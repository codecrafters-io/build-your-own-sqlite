Now that you're comfortable with jumping across database pages, let's dig a little deeper and read data from
rows in a table.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_program.sh sample.db "SELECT name FROM apples"
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
Granny Smith
Fuji
Honeycrisp
Golden Delicious
```

The order of rows returned doesn't matter.

Rows are stored on disk in the [Record Format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format), which is
just an ordered sequence of values. To extract data for a single column, you'll need to know the order of that
column in the sequence. You'll need to parse the table's `CREATE TABLE` statement to do this. The `CREATE TABLE`
statement is stored in the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table's `sql` column.

Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
