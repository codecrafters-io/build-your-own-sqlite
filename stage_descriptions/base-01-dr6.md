In this stage, you'll implement the `.dbinfo` [dot command](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#special_commands_to_sqlite3_dot_commands_), which prints metadata about a SQLite database.

### `.dbinfo`

The `.dbinfo` command is executed like this:
```
$ sqlite3 sample.db .dbinfo
```

It outputs metadata about the database file:
```yaml
database page size:  4096
write format:        1
read format:         1
...
number of tables:    5
schema size:         330
data version:        1
```

In this stage, your `.dbinfo` command only needs to output the "database page size."

### Database file

The SQLite database file begins with the database header. The database page size is stored in the header, right after the magic string. It's a 2-byte, big-endian value (read left-to-right).
```
// Start of file
53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66 6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00  // Magic string: "SQLite format 3" + null terminator.
10 00                                            /* Database page size, in bytes.
                                                    Here, the page size is 4096 bytes. */
...
```

### Tests

Here's how the tester will execute your program:
```
$ ./your_program.sh sample.db .dbinfo
```

Your program must print the database page size of the database file, like this:
```
database page size: 4096
```

### Notes

- For more information about the SQLite database file format, see the [Database File Format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#the_database_header) guide.
- Database headers use big-endian to store multi-byte fields. See the [MDN article on endianness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness) to learn more.
