This stage is similar to the previous one, just that the tester will query for multiple columns instead of just
one.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_program.sh sample.db "SELECT name, color FROM apples"
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
Granny Smith|Light Green
Fuji|Red
Honeycrisp|Blush Red
Golden Delicious|Yellow
```

Just like in the previous stage, the order of rows doesn't matter.

Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
