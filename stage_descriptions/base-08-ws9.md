Time to play with larger amounts of data!

In this stage you'll deal with the same syntax as before: a query with a `WHERE` clause. However, this time, the
table you'll be querying will be larger and it'll span multiple pages.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_program.sh superheroes.db "SELECT id, name FROM superheroes WHERE eye_color = 'Pink Eyes'"
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
297|Stealth (New Earth)
790|Tobias Whale (New Earth)
1085|Felicity (New Earth)
2729|Thrust (New Earth)
3289|Angora Lapin (New Earth)
3913|Matris Ater Clementia (New Earth)
```

The tester is going to use a sample database of superheroes that is ~1MB in size. You can download a small
version of this to test locally, read the **Sample Databases** section in the **README** of your repository.

You'll need to traverse a [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) in this stage. If you're unfamiliar with
how B-trees work or just need a refresher, Vaidehi Joshi's
[Busying Oneself With B-Trees](https://medium.com/basecs/busying-oneself-with-b-trees-78bbf10522e7) is a good place to
start. For specifics on how SQLite stores B-trees on disk, read the
[B-tree Pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages) documentation section.

Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
