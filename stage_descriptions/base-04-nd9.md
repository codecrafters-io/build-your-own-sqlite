Now that you've gotten your feet wet with the [SQLite database file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html),
it's time to move on to actual SQL!

In this stage, your program will need to read the count of rows from a table.

Here's how the tester will execute your program:

```
$ ./your_program.sh sample.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM apples"
```

and here's the output it expects:

```
4
```

You'll need to read the table's row from the [`sqlite_schema`](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table and
follow the `rootpage` value to visit the page corresponding to the table. For now you can assume that the contents
of the table are small enough to fit inside the root page. We'll deal with tables that span multiple pages in
stage 7.

Remember: You don't need to implement a full-blown SQL parser just yet. We'll get to that in the
next stages. For now you can just split the input by " " and pick the last item to get the table name.

Do not use a SQLite client library, implement the SQLite logic yourself.
